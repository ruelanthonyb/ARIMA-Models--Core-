    "* Make a datetime index using the Date column with a business day frequency ('B')\n",
    "* Check for and address null values.\n",
    "* Check the time series for stationarity.\n",
    "    * Determine the number of differencing (d) needed to make the data stationary. (We recommend using pmdarima's ndiffs)\n",
    "* Use ACF/PACF plots of the stationary data to estimate initial time series model orders​ (p,d,q)\n",
    "* Split the time series into training and test data. Use a test_size of one quarter (13 weeks X 5 business days)\n",
    "* Fit an ARIMA model based on the orders determined during your exploration.\n",
    "    * Make forecasts with your model.\n",
    "    * Plot the forecasts versus the test data.\n",
    "    * Obtain metrics for evaluation.\n",
    "* Try at least one variation of the model for comparison (we recommend using a loop to try combinations of model orders)\n",
    "* A MAPE of less than 2% on the test data is achievable.\n",
    "* Choose a final model and explain:\n",
    "    * How good was your model, according to your Mean Absolute Percentage Error?\n",
    "    * How good was your model in terms of how well the forecast seems to follow the test data, visually?  (Hint: You may want to plot fewer training data lags to see this)"
